This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0x440e126d35c767f263ad60029d68b9f1a946caedcc51ae10266f28e305fffe40","urls":["bzz-raw://87eaf2dfa0a988fd31e8b44703ffbf21a99a8c663263c2fad2c26dc9a120d5c3","dweb:/ipfs/QmenpSEG3kX4SbXDuDVDi7EwHgSrRTYrbEdJ1H2H14HxGZ"]}},"version":1}
